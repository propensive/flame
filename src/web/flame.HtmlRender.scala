// Renders a REPL result value as an HTML string for the web front-end, choosing the renderer by what
// typeclass can be resolved for the value's (static) type — a cascade:
//   1. a honeycomb `Renderable` → render to an `Html` node;
//   2. else a spectacular `Showable` → its text;
//   3. else `toString`.
// The `Showable`/`toString` text is wrapped in a `#text` node and serialized, so honeycomb HTML-escapes
// it: EVERY branch yields HTML-safe `Text` (a value whose text contains `<`/`&` cannot break the DOM).
//
// `render` is inlined into the compiled REPL wrapper (where the value's static type — and its
// Renderable/Showable instances — are in scope). It binds each summoned given by name and calls its
// typeclass method directly (`renderable.render` / `showable.text`), and delegates serialization to the
// public `serialize`/`escape` helpers, so the wrapper needs no honeycomb/spectacular extension imports
// — only `flame.HtmlRender` on the classpath.
